// You are given an array h[] where each element represents the height of a vertical line drawn on the x-axis at that index.
// The task is to find two lines such that together with the x-axis they form a container that can hold the maximum amount of water.

// The containerâ€™s water-holding capacity is determined by the shorter of the two lines and the distance between them.

// Return the maximum water area possible.

// Example:
// Input: h = {1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7}
// Output: 49

// Explanation: The maximum container is formed between lines at indices 1 and 8 (heights 8 and 7), with width 8 - 1 = 7.
// So, water area = min(8,7) * 7 = 49.
